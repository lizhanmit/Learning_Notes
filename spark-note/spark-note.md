# Spark Note

Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose distributed / cluster computing system. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming.

## Spark Core

### Architecture  

A Job includes multiple RDDs.

A RDD can be broken into multiple Stages.

A Stages get broken into multiple Tasks that are distributed to nodes on the cluster and then executed.

![spark-architecture.png](img/spark-architecture.png)

![img/spark-hdfs-architecture.png](img/spark-hdfs-architecture.png)

![spark-architecture-2.png](img/spark-architecture-2.png)

There is a **BlockManager** storage module in **Executor**, which uses both RAM and disk as storage devices in order to reduce IO overhead effectively.

When executing an application, Driver will apply resources from Cluster Manager, start up Executors, send program code and files to Executors, and then execute Tasks on Executors.

### Cluster Resource Manager

- Standalone
- Yarn
- Mesos
- Kubernetes

Spark built-in cluster resource manager (standalone) is not easy to use. It is more limited than other cluster managers. The cluster can only run Spark. **DO NOT** use it generally.

Mesos integrates with Spark better than Yarn.

You can use Mesos and Yarn at the same time. Mesos is for **coarse-grained** management allocating resource to Docker, and then Yarn is for **fine-grained** management.

---

### RDD

- A RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) is essentially a **read-only** partition record set.
- Each RDD can be divided into multiple partitions. Each partition is a dataset fragment. Each partition can be stored on different nodes in the cluster. (parallel computing)
- Virtually everything in Spark is built on top of RDDS.
- One thing that you might use RDDs for is to parallelize raw data that you have stored in memory on the driver machine. For instance, `spark.sparkContext.parallelize(Seq(1,2,3)).toDF()`.

#### Partitioning

##### Partitioning Rule

- The number of partitions should be equal to the number or its integer multiple of CPU cores in the cluster as possible.
- Each partition is generally between 100 - 200 MB.

##### Default Partition Number

Configure default partition number through set the parameter `spark.default.parallelism`.

- Local model: Number of CPU of local machine. If `local[N]` has been set, default partition number is N.
- Mesos: 8.
- Standalone or Yarn: Max value between number of CPU cores in the cluster and 2.

##### Manually Configure Partition

RDD partitioning is automatic but can be done manually through programming.

- When creating a RDD using `textFile()` or `parallelize()` methods, specify it. For example, `sc.textFile(<path>, <partitionNum>)`.
  - By default, Spark creates one partition for each block of the file (blocks being 128MB by default in HDFS).
  - You cannot have fewer partitions than blocks.
- When getting a new RDD by transformation, invoke `repartition(<partitionNum>)` method. For example, `rdd2 = rdd1.repartition(4)`. 4 partitions.
  - Check number of partitions: `rdd2.partitions.size`.

##### Stage Division & Dependencies

- Narrow dependencies: The relationship between RDDs is 1 : 1 or many : 1.
- Wide dependencies: The relationship between RDDs is 1 : many or many : many.

Create a new stage when it comes across wide dependencies.

![stage-division-according-to-dependencies.png](img/stage-division-according-to-dependencies.png)

Optimize for dependencies:  

- Do as many narrow dependencies together before hitting a wide dependency.  
- Try to group wide dependency transformations together, possibly inside a single function and do it once.  

#### RDD Running Process

![rdd-running-process-3.png](img/rdd-running-process-3.png)

![spark-transformations-dag.png](img/spark-transformations-dag.png)

#### Printing Elements of an RDD

It is common to print out the elements of an RDD using `<rdd_var>.foreach(println)` or `<rdd_var>.map(println)`.

- On a single machine, OK.
- In cluster mode, the methods called by executors will print output on executors rather than the driver.

To print all elements on the driver, you may use collect all RDDs to the driver firstly and then print: `<rdd_var>.collect().foreach(println)`.

- This will cause the driver to run out of memory.
- Thus, only print a few elements for testing: `<rdd_var>.take(<number_of_elements>).foreach(println)`.

---

### Dataset

Datasets and DataFrames are distributed table-like collections with well-defined rows and columns.

- After Spark 2.0, RDDs are replaced by Datasets. The RDD interface is still supported. **The trend in Spark is to use RDDs less and Datasets more.**
- Datasets are similar to RDDs but are **strongly typed** that mapped to relational schema.
- Datasets can explicitly wrap a given struct or type. (Dataset[Person], Dataset[(String, Double)])
- The Dataset API gives users the ability to assign a Java/Scala class to the records within a DataFrame and manipulate it as a collection of typed objects.

#### Advantages

- Datasets are more efficient.
  - They can be serialized very efficiently, even better than Kryo.
  - Optimal execution plans can be determined at compile time.
- Datasets allow for better interoperability.
  - MLLib and Spark Streaming are moving toward using Datasets instead of RDDs for their primary API.  
- Datasets simplify development.
  - You can perform most SQL operations on a dataset with one line.

Processing or transmitting over the network:

- RDD: using Java serialization or Kryo.
- Dataset: using a specialized Encoder to serialize the objects.
  - This Encoder is highly optimized and generates bytecode at run time for serialization and deserialization.

Two ways to create a Dataset:

- from Hadoop InputFormats (such as HDFS files).
- by transforming other Datasets.

RDDs can be converted to Datasets with `.toDF()`.

![when-to-use-datasets.png](img/when-to-use-datasets.png)

---

### DataFrame  

- A DataFrame simply represents a table of data with rows and columns. 
- A DataFrame is a kind of distributed dataset on basis of RDD.
- **A DataFrame is a distributed set of `Row` objects or `Dataset[Row]`.**
- Each `Row` object represents a row of record, which provides detailed schema info.
- `Row` is an untyped JVM object.
- Through DataFrame, Spark SQL is able to know column name and type of the dataset.
- When you are using DataFrames, you are taking advantage of Spark's optimized internal Catalyst format. 
- Can be created from:
  - structured data files
  - Hive tables
  - external databases
  - existing RDDs: `val myDF = spark.createDataFrame(myRDD, mySchema)`

#### RDD VS DataFrame VS Dataset

![rdd-dataframe-dataset.png](img/rdd-dataframe-dataset.png)

- DataFrame maps to a collection of Row-type objects. 
- Dataset maps to a collection of objects. 
- DataFrames schema is inferred at **runtime**; but a Dataset can be inferred at **compile time**.
  - faster detection of errors and better optimization

---

### RDD -> DataFrame

![difference-between-rdd-and-dataframe.png](img/difference-between-rdd-and-dataframe.png)

Two ways to convert RDD to DataFrame:

- Use Reflection to infer the schema of the RDD that contains specific type data.
  - Firstly define a case class. Then Spark will convert it to DataFrame implicitly.
  - This way is suitable for the RDD whose data type is known.
  - More concise code.
  - Currently (Spark 2.4), Spark SQL does not support converting JavaBeans to DataFrames that contain Map field(s).
- Use programming interface to construct a schema and apply it to an existing RDD.
  - Construct Datasets when the columns and their types are not known until runtime.
  - More verbose.
  - Steps:
    1. Create an RDD of `Rows` from the original RDD.
    2. Create the schema represented by a `StructType` matching the structure of Rows in the RDD created in Step 1.
    3. Apply the schema to the RDD of `Rows` via `createDataFrame()` method provided by `SparkSession`.

---

### Structured API Execution

Steps: 

1. Write DataFrame / Dataset / SQL Code.
2. If valid code, Spark converts this to a Logical Plan.
3. Spark transforms this Logical Plan to a Physical Plan, checking for optimizations along the way through Catalyst Optimizer.
4. Spark then executes this Physical Plan (RDD manipulations) on the cluster.

![catalyst-optimizer.png](img/catalyst-optimizer.png)

#### Logical Plan

![logical-planning-process.png](img/logical-planning-process.png)

#### Physical Plan 

![physical-planning-process.png](img/physical-planning-process.png)

#### Execution

Spark performs further optimizations at runtime, generating native Java bytecode that can remove entire tasks or stages during execution.

---

### Schema

- Schema-on-read
  - Infer schema automatically.
  - Inaccurate, precision issues.
- Define schema manually through StructType and StructField
  - Use this in production especially for untyped sources like CSV and JSON files.

#### Column

Different ways to construct or refer a column: 

- `col("columnName")`
- `column("columnName")`
- `$"columnName"` (in Scala)
- `'columnName` (in Scala)
- `expr("columnName")` (the most flexible)

- Columns are just expressions.
- Columns and transformations of those columns compile to the same logical plan as parsed expressions. For example, `expr("columnName - 5")` = `expr("columnName") - 5`, because Spark compiles these to a logical tree specifying the order of operations.

#### Row

- Each row in a DataFrame is a single record.
- A record is an object of type Row.
- Row objects internally represent arrays of bytes. 

- Create a Row: `val myRow = Row("hello", null, 1, false)`
- Access a Row: 
  - `myRow(0)`: type Any
  - `myRow(0).asInstanceOf[String]`: type String
  - `myRow.getString(0)`: type String
  - `myRow.getInt(2)`: type Int

---

### Shared Variables

#### Broadcast Variables

- Use `SparkContext.broadcast(<var>)` to create a broadcast variable from a normal variable, which is cached on each machine.
- The broadcast variable is like a wrapper of its corresponding normal variable.
- The broadcasted data is cached in serialized form and deserialized before running each task.
- After the broadcast variable is created, it should be used instead of the original normal variable in any functions run on the cluster.
- All functions in the cluster can access the broadcast variable, thereby you do not need to repeatedly send the original normal variable to all nodes.
- After creating the broadcast variable, the original normal variable cannot be modified (is **read-only**). Consequently, the broadcast variable on all nodes are the same.
- **When to use**: when a very large variable need to be used repeatedly.

For instance,

1. Create: `val broadcastVar = sc.broadcast(Array(1,2,3))`
2. Get value: `broadcastVar.value`

#### Accumulators

- Used for counter and sum functions.
- Create: `<accum_var> = SparkContext.longAccumulator()` or `<accum_var> = SparkContext.doubleAccumulator()`
- Use: `<accum_var>.add(<number>)`
- These accumulators are available on Slave nodes, but **Slave nodes cannot read them**.
- Master node is the only one that can read and compute the aggregate of all updates. `<accum_var>.value`
- Spark natively supports accumulators of numeric types, and programmers can add support for new types.

For instance,

1. Create: `val nErrors=sc.accumulator(0.0)`
2. Load file: `val logs = sc.textFile("/Users/akuntamukkala/temp/output.log")`
3. Count number of "error": `logs.filter(_.contains(“error”)).foreach(x => nErrors += 1)`
4. Get value: `nErrors.value`

##### Accumulator Update

- For action operations, accumulator updates in each task will only be applied once even if the task restarts.
- For transformation operation, each task’s update may be applied more than once if tasks or job stages are re-executed.

---

### Caching / Persisting

- By default, each transformed RDD may be recomputed each time you run an action on it.
- Cache or persist datasets in memory on nodes.
- Future actions are faster (often by more than 10x).
- `<rdd_var>.cache()` for default storage level - `MEMORY_ONLY`.
- Or `<rdd_var>.persist()` with a specified StorageLevel parameter.
- Spark removes cached data automatically in a least-recently-used (LRU) fashion.
- Or use `<rdd_var>.unpersist()` if you want manually.

When to cache data:

- When doing data validation and cleaning.
- When querying a small “hot” dataset.
- Cache for iterative algorithm like PageRank.
- Generally, **DO NOT** use for input data as input data is too large.

#### Storage Level

- `MEMORY_ONLY` is the 1st choice.
- `MEMORY_ONLY_SER` is the 2nd choice. (Java and Scala)
- **DO NOT** use disk unless computing datasets are expensive, or amount of the data is large. Recomputing a partition may be as fast as reading it from disk.

---

### Shuffle

- Shuffle moves data across worker nodes, which is costly.
- It involves disk I/O, data serialization, and network I/O.
- It generates a large number of intermediate files on disk.
- By default, when we perform a shuffle, Spark outputs 200 shuffle partitions. You can specify it through `spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "<number_of_shuffle_you_want>")`.
- Use minimal shuffle as possible and do them in late stages for better performance.  
- **DO NOT** use `groupByKey() + reduce()` if you can use `reduceByKey()`.
  - `groupByKey()` does not receive functions as parameter. When invoking it, Spark will move all key-value pairs, which will result in big overhead and transmission delay.

No shuffle transformations:  

- map
- filter  
- flatMap
- mapPartitions  
- ...

Shuffle transformations:  

- distinct  
- groupByKey  
- reduceByKey
- join  
- countByValue
- ...

---

### Lazy Evaluation

Taking advantage of lazy evaluation:  

- Do as many transformations as possible before hitting an action.  
- Avoid debugging statements with shuffle, e.g. printing counts.  

---

### API

![transformation-api.png](img/transformation-api.png)

![action-api.png](img/action-api.png)

The difference between `foreach()` and `map()`:

- `foreach()`: return void or no return value.
- `map()`: return dataset object.

---

## Spark SQL

- Use RDD to process text file.
- Use Spark SQL to process structured data.

![sparkSQL-shell-access.png](img/sparkSQL-shell-access.png)

### SparkSession

From Spark 2.0, `SparkSession` interface was introduced to realize all functions of `SQLContext` and `HiveContext`.

Using `SparkSession`, you can

- load data from different data source and transfer to DataFrame.
- transfer DataFrame to table in `SQLContext`.
- use SQL statements to operate data.

---

### Spark SQL & Hive

It is compulsory to add Hive support for Spark in order to accessing Hive using Spark.

Pre-compile version Spark from official site generally does not contain Hive support. You need to compile the source code.

## Spark ML

- Machine learning algorithms in MLlib require that data is represented as numerical values. 
- All machine learning algorithms in Spark take as input a Vector type, which must be a set of numerical values. 

### ML Workflow

Steps: 

1. Data preprocessing: prepare **trainDataFrame** and **testDataFrame** based on raw data without using any ML concepts.
2. Data processing: feature engineering and get **transformation pipeline**. 
3. Prepare for training.
    1. Transformation pipeline fits trainDataFrame to get **fitted pipeline**.
    2. Fitted pipeline transforms trainDataFrame to get **transformedTraining**.
4. Cache transformedTraining.
5. Prepare for ML model.
    1. Create **untrained model**.
    2. Untrained model fits transformedTraining to get **trained model**.
    3. Trained model computes cost of transformedTraining.
6. Test.
    1. Fitted pipeline transforms testDataFrame to get **transformedTest**.
    2. Trained model computes cost of transformedTest.

Estimator receives an input DataFrame via `.fit()` method, and then generate a Transformer.

- Estimator: algorithm
- Transformer: model

![ml-workflow.png](img/ml-workflow.png)

![ml-workflow-2.png](img/ml-workflow-2.png)

- Red frame: estimator
- Blue frame: transformer

1. Create a new pipeline to fit trainingData, and then generate a pipelineModel.
2. Use this model to transform testData, and then get DataFrame with prediction.

![ml-pipeline.png](img/ml-pipeline.png)

### Feature Transformation

Feature transformation: transformation of label and index.

`StringIndexer`

- Construction order of the index is the frequency of label.
- When encoding labels, give priority to those with higher frequency.
- The index of the label with highest frequency is 0.

---

## System Scaling

### Scale Kafka Connect  

- Configure `tasks.max` to number of tables/files.  
- Create different instances for different tables/files.  
- Increase frequency of polling.  
- Use Kafka Connect in cluster mode.  

### Scale Kafka Broker  

- Create multiple partitions for each topic.  
- Increase nodes in the cluster.  

### Scale Spark Streaming  

- Have a single instance of the drive program with separate threads for each stream in the driver.  
- Create separate driver instances for each stream.
- Spark cluster – add nodes.  

### Scale MySQL

- Keep table size small, thereby keeping the entire table in memory, which makes updates and querying very quick.
- Use distributed databases with a lot of nodes that are good for frequent updates – e.g. Cassandra.

## Glossary

- **Avro**: Avro format is great for **row oriented data**. The schema is stored in another file.
- **Parquet**: It is a very efficient format. Generally, you take .csv or .json files. Then do ETL. Then write down to parquet files for future analysis. Parquet is great for **column oriented data**. The schema is in the file.
