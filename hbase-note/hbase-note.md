# HBase Note

HBase is a NoSQL database, a distributed, scalable, **column-oriented** database running on top of HDFS, which is modeled after Google's BigTable.

When to use: 

- HBase is used to host very large tables - billions of rows X millions of columns. You should have enough data. Otherwise, use RDBMS for a few thousand/million rows.
- Use HBase when you need random, real-time read/write access to your Big Data. 
- A great amount of data is stored redundantly for performant analysis.
- HBase is not relational. Does not support SQL. Use it if you do not need some RDBMS features (e.g. typed columns, secondary indexes, transactions, advanced query languages, etc.).
- When you have enough hardware. HDFS does not do well with anything less than 5 DataNodes plus a NameNode.

## Basics

### Data Model

#### Namespace

A logical grouping of tables analogous to a database in RDBMS, which indicates the division of business logic.

It is used for multi-tenancy related features:

- Quota Management: Restrict the amount of resources (i.e. regions, tables) a namespace can consume.
- Namespace Security Administration: Provide another level of security administration for tenants.
- Region server groups: A namespace/table can be pinned onto a subset of RegionServers thus guaranteeing a coarse level of isolation.

#### Cells

The timestamp is auto-assigned by HBase at the time of cell insertion.

A cell’s content is an uninterpreted array of bytes.

#### Rows

Rows are sorted by row key. The sort is byte-ordered.

Row keys are byte arrays, so anything can serve as a row key.

Row updates are atomic.

#### Columns

Format: `<column_family>:<qualifier>`

Column families must be specified up front as part of the table schema definition, but new column family members (qualifiers) can be added on demand.

All column family members are stored together on the filesystem.

Tuning and storage specifications are done at the column family level.

Column family attributes: 

- Whether the family content should be compressed on the filesystem.
- How many versions of a cell to keep. 


#### HBase VS RDBMS

For HBase,

- Distribution is intrinsic.
- column-oriented
- horizontally partitioned and replicated
- Cells are versioned. 
- Rows are sorted. 
- Columns can be added on the fly by the client as long as the column family they belong to preexists.
- **Does not support secondary indexes (indexing of other columns).**
- commodity hardware
- fault tolerance

For RDBMS, 

- fixed-schema
- row-oriented
- ACID properties
- secondary indexes
- complex queries
- complex inner and outer joins
- costly hardware

#### Regions

Tables are automatically partitioned horizontally by HBase into regions.

Initially, a table comprises a single region, but as the region grows it eventually crosses a configurable size threshold, at which point it splits at a row boundary into two new regions of approximately equal size. 

Regions are the units that get distributed over an HBase cluster. Each node hosts a subset of the table’s total regions.

### Column- VS Row-Oriented

Column-oriented: analytical application, high data compression ratio

Row-oriented: more transactional operations, low data compression ratio

### HBase Master

lightly loaded

- Bootstrap a virgin install.
- Assign regions to registered regionservers.

### Regionservers

- Handle client read/write requests.
- Manage region splits.
- Communicate with HBase master.

### ZooKeeper

- Host vitals:
  - location of the `hbase:meta` catalog table
  - address of the current cluster master
- Assignment of regions is mediated via ZooKeeper, which hosts the assignment transaction state in and makes it recovery.

### HDFS

HBase persists data via the Hadoop filesystem API. 

By default, HBase writes to the local filesystem, which is used for experimenting with your initial HBase install, but not for production.

The first configuration made in an HBase cluster usually involves
pointing HBase at the HDFS cluster.

### Catalog Table

name of catalog table: `hbase:meta`

Maintains the current list, state, and locations of regions.

Entries in `hbase:meta` are keyed by region name.

Region name format: `table_name,region's_start_row,time_of_creation.MD5_hash_of_all_above.`

Example: `TestTable,xyz,1279729913622.1b6e176fb8d8aa88fd4ab6bc80247ece.`

### BlockCache 

Locations and user-space region start and stop rows are cached, so clients do not need to go back to the `hbase:meta` table to figure out hosting regions every time, until there is a failure.

### Operations

#### New Client Connection

Steps:

1. Connect to ZooKeeper to learn the location of `hbase:meta`.
2. Look up hosting user-space region and its location. 
3. Interact directly with the hosting regionserver.

#### Write Data

Steps:  

1. Append new data to a commit log.
2. Add to an in-memory "memstore".
3. When a memstore is full, flush content to the filesystem.

Commit log is hosted on HDFS, so fault tolerant.

#### Read Data

Steps:

1. Region's memstore is consulted. If sufficient versions are found
reading memstore alone, the query completes there. 
2. Otherwise, flush files are consulted in order, from newest to oldest. Result: found or not found.

#### Compaction 

A background process compacts flush files once their number has exceeded a threshold, rewriting many files as one.

The process cleans out versions beyond the schema-configured maximum and removes deleted and expired cells.

## Coding

- `list`: List all created tables in the current DB.
- `create '<table_name>', '<column_family_name>'`
- `describe '<table_name>'`: Check basic info of the table.
- `scan '<table_name>'`: Check all data of a table.
- `put '<table_name>', '<row_key_value>', '<column_family_name>:<column_name>', '<cell_value>'`: Insert data.
- `get '<table_name>', '<row_key_value>'`: Check data of a row.
- `get '<table_name>', '<row_key_value>', '<column_family_name>:<column_name>`: Check data of a cell.
- `truncate '<table_name>'`: Delete data in the table.
- Delete a table: `disable '<table_name>'` and then `drop '<table_name>'`
- `count '<table_name>'`: Type this in shell is not distributed. So, **for large tables the MapReduce program is preferable.**

Take "student" table as an example:

| id | name     | gender | age |
| :--| :--------| :------| :---|
| 1  | Zhangsan | F      | 23  |
| 2  | Lisi     | M      | 24  |

1. `create 'student', 'info'`
2. `put 'student', '1', 'info:name', 'Zhangsan'`
3. `put 'student', '1', 'info:gender', 'F'`
4. `put 'student', '1', 'info:age', '23'`
5. `put 'student', '2', 'info:name', 'Lisi'`
6. `put 'student', '2', 'info:gender', 'M'`
7. `put 'student', '2', 'info:age', '24'`
