[What is OKR?](https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/what-is-okr/#top)

Objectives and Key Results (OKR)

OKRs are frequently set, tracked, and re-evaluated – usually quarterly.

The primary purpose of OKR is to create alignment in the organization. 

Formula: I will (Objective) as measured by (this set of Key Results).

## Concepts

### Objectives 

Objectives: Memorable qualitative descriptions of what you want to achieve. Objectives should be short, inspirational and engaging. An Objective should motivate and challenge the team.

### Key Results

Key Results: A set of metrics that measure your progress towards the Objective. For each Objective, you should have a set of **2 to 5** Key Results. More than that and no one will remember them. **If it does not have a number, it is not a Key Result.**

## Tips

OKR should be separated from rewards.
